# Postit
A simple social media app that I developed on my own to test my web developement skills \
after I finished the Udemy course 'Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023' by Jose Salvatierra. \
This website was created using HTML, CSS, and Flask. Here is the link to the deployed [Postit](https://postit-3n3g.onrender.com). \
It can take a while to load due to the deployment service that I used \
so don't worry if it seems to not be loading for a bit.
